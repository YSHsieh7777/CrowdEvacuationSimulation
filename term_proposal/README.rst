This directory collects the proposals for the term project.  You should use a
PR to submit your proposal.

The proposal is to help you plan and implement the project.  The project will
be `graded based on
<https://github.com/yungyuc/nsd/blob/master/notebook/index.ipynb>`__:

* Good engineering infrastructure.
* Correct implementation and solution to the problem.
* Adequate architecture.
* Good presentation.

The proposal won't be graded separately, but as part of "good presentation".

The following file formats are accepted for the proposal: plain text,
reStructuredText, markdown, PDF, and word (.doc or .docx).  The
plain-text-based formats (plain text, reStructuredText, and markdown) and PDF
are preferred.  Use English.

Your submission PR needs to create a sub-directory using exactly your GitHub
username as your working directory (``$WORK``).  The PR needs to be created
against the ``term-project`` branch.  (Not ``master``.)
