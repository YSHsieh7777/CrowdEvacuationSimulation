# Term Proposal - Crowd Simulation

## Motivation



## Ideas

 - Simulate the flocking behavior of humen.
 - Simulate the panic behavior of people when they meets threat.
 - Take human's thought into consideration.

## Example

Crowd evacuation simulation exmaple. Each dot represents a persion. The circle on left side represents danger. The color on each dot is the panic degree.
